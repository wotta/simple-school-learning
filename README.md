# Strapi 4 & Next.js 11 template

![Banner](banner.png)

This is my custom template starter. The frontend is build with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and the backend is build with [Strapi](https://strapi.io/).
The repository is based on [Strapi starter blog next](https://github.com/strapi/strapi-starter-next-blog).

See working demo [here](https://monosnap.com/file/mtHxcFrjMceOFN8V9KKnoB2cetcNaW).

## Installation

To install the backend and the frontend, run the following commands:

```bash
$ yarn install
```

> This should also run yarn install for the `backend` and `frontend` folder.

## Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
$ yarn dev
```
